## Attribution

Id like to thank the following:

- [Z80 common ic symbols and footprints KiCAD by flypie](https://github.com/flypie/Z80-CPU-for-KiCAD) I used their footprint and adjusted it.
- [KiCad 6: Change Track Width](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDhIbKeDssM) I was wondering something, then discovered i used too small pitched headers instead of needing smaller traces. still helpfull.
